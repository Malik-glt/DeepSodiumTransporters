# NA_mCNN: Classification of Sodium Transporters in Membrane Proteins:
This study focuses on the computational classification of sodium transporters from membrane proteins using a multi-window scanning CNN Model integrated with protein language model embeddings, ProtTRans. Sodium transporters play a critical role in various physiological processes, and their accurate identification is crucial for understanding human health and disease mechanisms, including their involvement in neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.

# MethodologyÂ 

We obtained sodium transporter and membrane protein data from Uniprot [1]. Specifically, sodium transporters found in plasma membranes were identified using the query described in the Supplementary Materials. This dataset contains 1,697 sodium transporter sequences and 13,111 membrane protein sequences . With Prottrans, a previously trained protein language model, we were able to extract complex features from protein sequences and fine-tune them based on our dataset. This method allowed for more accurate predictive modeling since it captured all encoded information within the sequences [2]. To provide a comprehensive analysis of protein sequences, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with a variety of window scanning methods. In this strategy, multiple window sizes were considered in order to evaluate sequence patterns in a comprehensive way. Figure 1 shows the complete architecture, while Figure 2 shows the classification model.
